# Welcome to the 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge!

With many of us around the world being encouraged to stay indoors and work from home, this is the perfect opportunity to focus on studying. In order to stay focused, LeetCode is running the 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge for the month of April 2020. A problem will appear here at midnight PDT each day with 24 hours of time to solve it.
